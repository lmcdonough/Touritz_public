<strong>A portion of Django Code I have written for a tour based company that I decided to make public for academic purposes.</strong>
<div>The main Django product is a application that allows anyone to create their own tours. 
The user can add tour points by dropping markers on a map, and even add photos audio and video to their tour points. Finally, they can share their tours with your family and friends.</div>
